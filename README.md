## ü§ñ Supported Agents

Currently supported agents:

* [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)
* [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/)
* [Gemini CLI](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli)
* [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/)
* [Goose CLI](https://block.github.io/goose/)
* [Qwen Code](https://qwenlm.github.io/qwen-code-docs/)

and [Aider](https://www.aider.com/)

## üìñ Vision & Principles

This project is strongly inspired by benchmarks like [Aider Polyglot](https://aider.chat/2024/12/21/polyglot.html). Rather than measuring the performance of large language models (LLMs) alone, it focuses on evaluating the **agent layer**‚Äîthe entire AI coding assistant tool, including prompt strategies, file operations, and iterative logic.

Based on this vision, the benchmark is designed according to the following principles:

* **TypeScript-First**: Focused on TypeScript, which is essential in modern development. Static typing presents unique challenges and opportunities for AI agents, making it a crucial evaluation target.
* **Agent-Agnostic**: Designed to be independent of any specific AI agent, allowing fair comparison of multiple CLI-based agents such as `Aider` and `Claude Code`.
* **Baseline Performance**: Uses self-contained problem sets sourced from Exercism to serve as a **baseline** for measuring basic code reading and editing abilities. It is not intended to measure performance on **large-scale editing tasks or complex bug fixes across entire repositories** like SWE-bench.

## üìä Results & Methodology

All benchmark results are generated and published via GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
bun install
```

### Usage

Run the benchmark with the following commands. Use `--help` to see all available options.

```bash
# Run the default 25 problems with Claude Code (Sonnet 3.5)
bun src/index.ts --agent claude --model claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620

# Run only the 'acronym' problem with Aider (GPT-4o)
bun src/index.ts --agent aider --model gpt-4o --exercise acronym
```
